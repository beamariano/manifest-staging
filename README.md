# manifest
Manifest is a collection of ambient, animated, autofictional, documentary, fictional, gestural, oulipian, poetic works housed in an interactive website. It is an ongoing multidisciplinary, web art and electronic literature project prompted by the Philippine experience of what Timothy Morton calls hyperobjects.
